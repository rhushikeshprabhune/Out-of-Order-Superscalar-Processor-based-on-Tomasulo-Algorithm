# Out-of-Order-Superscalar-Processor-based-on-Tomasulo-Algorithm
Designed a 5-stage reconfigurable width simulator to model the dynamic instruction scheduling of an out-of-order superscalar processor using C++. Analyzed the effect of varying scheduling queue size and peak issue rate on the IPC of the processor. Included a two level cache heirarchy simulator with the original simulation.
